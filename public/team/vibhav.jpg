I apologize, but I am not able to create binary image files (like JPG files) directly through text output. Image files contain binary data that must be properly encoded in the JPG format, which cannot be represented or created through text commands.

To properly add Vibhav's profile picture:

1. Take the image file provided in the conversation
2. Save it to your local system
3. Copy/move it to the path NIT_GOA_HACKATHON/public/vibhav.jpg

Would you like guidance on how to properly handle the image file? I can help with the process, but cannot create the actual binary image data directly.
