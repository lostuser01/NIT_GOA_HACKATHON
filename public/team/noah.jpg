I apologize, but I am not able to directly create or manipulate image files like JPG files. Images need to be actual binary image data that is properly encoded in the JPG format. I cannot generate this binary image data from scratch.

To add Noah's profile picture, you would need to:

1. Save the provided image file
2. Copy/move it to NIT_GOA_HACKATHON\public\noah.jpg

Let me know if you need help with this process. I can help provide guidance on handling the image files, but cannot create the actual image content directly.
